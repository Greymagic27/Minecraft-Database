**All “cracked”, or “non premium” launchers are illegal, and __will steal your information__**.

By using one, you are theoretically subject to arrest. 
A few common examples of this is TLauncher, SKLauncher, and Salwyrr’s. Please note that this list is NOT exhaustive. 

It is required that you remove these launchers. Below is how to remove TLauncher specifically. Other launchers you can most likely uninstall with the windows uninstall tool. Make sure you run a virus scan with a tool like MalwareBytes.

TLauncher is known spyware. 
It will take your information, and sell it, 
including possible saved passwords. It will infect your actual Minecraft installation, and you all need to uninstall it in a special way.

To do this, find the .tlauncher folder and delete it. Then delete the .Minecraft folder. Make sure it’s uninstalled in the windows uninstall menu. Run a malware check with malware bytes, and reinstall from <https://minecraft.net/download>.

Pirating Minecraft is thievery. Don’t do it. If you wish to play Minecraft for free legally, visit <https://classic.minecraft.net/> or <https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/edition/pi>
