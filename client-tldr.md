# Don't use a client.

First, to clear things up, "PVP clients" don't do anything special. In simple terms, they are Forge loaders that don't let you load more mods, and take your information. All of the launchers below break the EULA simply by selling capes. **We will not provide support for any of the launchers listed below.**


### Lunar

Lunar Client is another launcher for Minecraft that should never be used. One of the most important reasons for this is their login security. Lunar client obfuscates your log files, meaning if you ever run into an issue, we can't help you at all. Lunar is also literally is capable of breaking your entire Minecraft installation, and trust me, it does. You can of course get all the exact same mods without the down sides. The only reason Lunar has gained popularity is because content creators are pain ungodly amounts of money to advertise their "client".

Lunar Client is an excuse for a launcher, that takes your information and tricks you into thinking you're getting more FPS by just using Optifine.


### Feather

Feather Client is one of the worst clients in existence right now, because of the things they do behind the scenes, and their beginnings. Feather client started off as a paid client, which for starters is not great. The creators of the client continued to steal tons of code from other developers, without any permission whatsoever. If you notice, the original trailer now has a lot of blurred areas because of legal action taken against them. Most of the client's code was stolen from Lunar client, of course illegally. The client is built on terrible, stolen code. If you take a quick look at their privacy policy, you can notice that they are legally allowed to log your IP address, and really do whatever they want with it, and furthermore, they don't have any rules on what they can and can't do with your voice chat information. Lastly, there are a few reports of the client sending suspicious information to third parties, so they are likely selling your information.

In conclusion, Feather Client is just a pile of garbage, that steals from you. You can get the exact same mods with Forge or Fabric which is completely safe.


### Badlion

Ignoring their absolutely hideous UI, their client basically has no rules on what they can do and take from you. Their Privacy Policy says that they have the rights to all your information, and they read from files that are extremally sensitive. If you are using this client it is highly recommended you change your password after uninstalling. Other than that, it's a Forge launcher. Everything can be done when just using classic forge, which is totally safe. Every creator using the client is being paid way too much money, and it gets revoked the instant the creator uses any other launcher. Their Anti-Cheat runs in the background 24/7, slowing your computer down always. It also has full control over your device.

Badlion isn't even a client, its just bloatware. It will steal your information, and slow down your device. You really should stop.


## Forge/Fabric

Forge or Fabric allows you to install any mod you want, for free. There are thousands of mods listed on [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/) and [CurseForge](https://beta.curseforge.com/minecraft/search?page=1&class=mc-mods&sortType=2&pageSize=20).

If you're on the latest version, use Fabric with this tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL2HtfhhhE

If you're on an older version like 1.8.9, use Forge with this tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xd4c0fkvS-k
